# lzfse for Go

## LZFSE

LZFSE is a Lempel-Ziv style data compression algorithm using Finite State Entropy coding.
It targets similar compression rates at higher compression and decompression speed compared to deflate using zlib.
It is introduced in the
[Compression library](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Performance/Reference/Compression/index.html) with OS X 10.11 and iOS 9.
